# Opensea Reimbursement

The inspiration for this project came from a viral Twitter post I saw from [@CryptoXpresso](https://twitter.com/CryptoXpresso/status/1591218382216404992). I had learned that Opensea was offering refunds for those who had failed transactions on the platform.

It was important to release this project ASAP, so the first draft lacked proper styling and only had the most vital functionality. Over time, I was able to create a better UI / UX. See my first and final drafts below.

## Vision

My vision for this project was to showcase all of the Ethereum transactions that failed an interaction with the Opensea contracts by simply inputting your Ethereum address or ENS name. I wanted to display it in a simple table with the date, transaction hash, gas fee, and etherscan link. I also wanted to clearly display the total Opensea reimbursement amount as well as an option to copy the table to an Excel sheet or to the Opensea Help Center.

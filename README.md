# Opensea Reimbursement

The inspiration for this project came from a viral Twitter post I saw from @CryptoXpresso. I had learned that Opensea was offering refunds for those who had failed transactions on the platform.

## Vision

My vision for this project was to showcase all of the Ethereum transactions that failed an interaction with the Opensea contracts by simply inputting your Ethereum address. I wanted to display it in a simple table with the date, transaction hash, gas fee, and etherscan link. I also wanted to clearly display the total Opensea reimbursement amount as well as an option to export the table to an Excel sheet.
